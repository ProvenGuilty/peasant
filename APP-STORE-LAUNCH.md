## Why $0.99?

### The Strategy

**Advantages:**
- Low barrier to entry (impulse purchase)
- Shows quality (not free/ad-supported)
- Revenue from day one
- No ads needed
- Simple pricing (no freemium complexity)

**Revenue Potential:**
- You keep $0.69 per sale (Apple takes 30%)
- 100 downloads = $69
- 500 downloads = $347
- 1,000 downloads = $693

**Break-Even:**
- Costs: ~$567/year (Apple $99 + EAS $348 + API $120)
- Need: ~820 downloads to break even
- Realistic first year: 100-500 downloads

### What You're Really Getting

Even if Peasant only makes $50:
- ✅ Published app developer credential
- ✅ Full product development experience
- ✅ App Store submission knowledge
- ✅ Real users and feedback

**That's worth way more than the costs!**

## Common Questions

### "Do I need a Mac?"
**No!** Expo EAS Build creates iOS apps in the cloud. You can do everything on Windows/Linux.

### "What if my app gets rejected?"
Apple provides feedback. You fix the issues and resubmit. Most apps get approved within 1-2 submissions.

### "Can I change the price later?"
Yes! You can adjust pricing anytime. Many developers start at $0.99 and raise it later.

### "What about Android?"
Chapter 6 focuses on iOS first. Android (Google Play) is easier and can be added later!

### "What if nobody buys it?"
The experience is valuable regardless. Plus, you can always make it free or adjust strategy.

### "How do refunds work?"
Apple handles refunds. Users can request within 90 days. You don't lose money on refunds.

### "Can I update the app after launch?"
Yes! You can submit updates anytime. Most developers update monthly.

## 🎯 What Is Peasant?

Peasant is a modular financial super app designed for working-class people. It teaches you the financial tricks that wealthy people already know and gives you the tools to escape the paycheck-to-paycheck trap.

### The Mission

**Stop being poor because you don't know what rich people know.**

Peasant breaks down the financial gatekeeping and gives you:
- The knowledge wealthy people learn from their parents
- The tools financial advisors charge thousands for
- The tricks that keep you poor (and how to stop them)
- A community of people who get it

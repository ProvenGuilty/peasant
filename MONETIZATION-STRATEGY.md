## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### Why $0.99?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Low barrier to entry** - Impulse purchase price
- ✅ **Perceived value** - Shows it's a quality app (not free/ad-supported)
- ✅ **Revenue from day one** - Every download generates income
- ✅ **No ads needed** - Better user experience
- ✅ **No freemium complexity** - Simpler to build and maintain
- ✅ **App Store credibility** - Paid apps often rank higher in quality

**Market Context:**
- Budget apps range from free to $50+
- $0.99 is the lowest paid tier
- Competes with free apps by offering premium AI features
- No subscription fatigue - one-time purchase

### Revenue Projections

**Conservative Estimates:**

| Downloads/Month | Revenue/Month | Revenue/Year |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 10 | $7 (after Apple's 30% cut) | $84 |
| 50 | $35 | $420 |
| 100 | $69 | $828 |
| 500 | $347 | $4,164 |
| 1,000 | $693 | $8,316 |

**Note:** Apple takes 30% ($0.30), you keep 70% ($0.69) per sale.

### Break-Even Analysis

**Costs to Launch:**
- Apple Developer Account: $99/year
- Expo EAS Build: ~$29/month = $348/year
- OpenAI API: ~$10/month = $120/year
- **Total Year 1:** ~$567

**Break-even:** 820 downloads (820 × $0.69 = $566)

**Realistic Goal:** 100-500 downloads in first year = $69-$347 revenue

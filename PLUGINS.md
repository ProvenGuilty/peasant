- Fast food is the poverty trap ($12/meal × 2 meals/day × 30 days = $720/month!)
- Cooking at home saves 70-80% on food costs
- Meal prep on Sunday = fast food convenience all week
- Batch cooking is the secret (make 10 burritos, freeze them)
- Generic ingredients = same taste, 1/3 the price
- Slow cooker = dump ingredients, come home to dinner
- Leftovers for lunch = another $300/month saved

**The Math:**
- **Fast food habit:** $720/month ($8,640/year)
- **Cooking at home:** $200/month ($2,400/year)

**The Irony:**
- Fast food = "convenient" but you wait 20 minutes
